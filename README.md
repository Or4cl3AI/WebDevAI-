# WebDevAI

WebDevAI is an AI-powered chat to website builder that allows users to chat with a conversational AI chatbot to generate and do all of the editing on their website. With a friendly and engaging conversational AI chatbot user interface, WebDevAI is your go-to no-code solution.

## Features

- A back-end server to store and process data.
- A database to store the website's content.
- A content management system (CMS) to allow users to create and edit content.
- A programming language to power the chatbot.
- A chatbot framework to help developers build chatbots.

## How it works

The back-end server stores the website's content, such as text, images, and videos. The database stores the website's users, their profiles, and their interactions with the chatbot. The CMS allows users to create and edit content, such as landing pages, blog posts, and product pages. The programming language understands and responds to natural language queries. The chatbot framework provides a set of tools and APIs that developers can use to build chatbots.

## Usage

The chat to website builder feature is one of the most important features of the website. It allows users to create stunning landing pages and multipage websites with ease, simply by chatting with a friendly and engaging conversational AI chatbot. The code is designed to make this feature as easy to use as possible.

## Recommendations

The code is also designed to make recommendations for ways to improve or change something for the better. For example, if the code detects that a user is struggling to create a landing page, it could recommend a different layout or design.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
